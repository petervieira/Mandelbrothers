Mandelbrothers is a tile-based RPG written in python in which you must fight off waves of enraged creatures in order to save your brother. The game consists of an overworld where the player fights to gather coins, and a shop where the player can purchase upgrades. These areas are connected by a portal, and the player must travel back and forth throughout the course of the game.
The game uses the pygame library to blit all the sprites, play the music and sound effects, and display text. The maps were creating using the program Tiled to create sprite layers and facilitate the drawing process. These maps are read using the pytmx library. All music and sound effects included in the game are original and were produced by us using www.beepbox.co. The sprite art is a mixture of original and online art licensed for personal and commercial use. The art sources are listed below.
